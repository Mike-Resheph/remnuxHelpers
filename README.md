This is a small collection of bash scripts for aiding in a speedy tirage of suspicious files
These small bash scripts may not be updated as they are served from elsewhere. There is nothing intelligent about them but are used to quickly run common tools on certain file types.

These are considered a backup but feel free to use or alter these in any way needed.
